- Inspectors: sources, logcat, layout hierarchy, edit your storage (db, SharedPrefs and Files) and info panels
- Auto generate a FriendlyLog with basic reproduction steps as well as advanced entries (lifecycle events, network requests, errors, device events,...)
- See a crash detail immediately and navigate to causing source lines
- Send flexible reports by email or other apps
- Customize your own tools, easily run your task and use our dev helpers.

## Requirements <a name="req"/>
- Project minSdkVersion >= 16
- Project support Java 8
- Dependencies migrated to androidX

## Set-up <a name="setup"/>
Basic set-up only require you to modify gradle files for your project. You don't need to extend Application extension needed

- Step 1: On your project's build.gradle file, add JitPack to allprojects repositories (TEMP).
```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        //...
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io"}
    }
}
```

- Step 2: On your app module's build.gradle, add our library as dependency and apply our plugin
  - Ensure minSdkVersion >= 16 (TEMP)
  - Make your project compatible with Java 8 (TEMP)
  - Add our library as dependency
  - Apply our gradle plugin
  - You can also include configurations using our Gradle extension

```gradle
apply plugin: 'com.android.application'

android {
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 16
    }

    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility = '1.8'
        targetCompatibility = '1.8'
    }
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'es.rafaco.inappdevtools:inappdevtools:0.0.37'
}

apply from: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rafaco/InAppDevTools/master/plugin/inappdevtools.gradle'

inappdevtools {
    enabled = true
    email = 'mail@domain.com'
}
```
